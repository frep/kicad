Projects
========
The following projects contains a pcb designed with kicad. All the needed schematics and footprints can be found in the library folder.   

Radxa Arduino Shield
--------------------
The RAS (Radxa Arduino Shield) is an addon-shield for the radxa rock (pro). It contains an arduino micro clone running at 3.3V connected over i2c with the radxa. The shield also includes an OLED 16x2 char display, also connected over i2c. It can be used by the radxa or the arduino.   

Lab bench PSU
-------------
A current-controlled, voltage-controlled lab bench psu based on the [usupply](http://www.eevblog.com/projects/usupply/) from David Jones. Instead of being portable, my focus is to transform an old pc-psu into an lab bench psu.
